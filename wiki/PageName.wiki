= Introduction =

This Wiki page will guide you through setting up the right-click integration in Windows.

= Details =

== Windows XP ==

Windows XP users can follow these simple steps:

 * Install the latest version of 2pix
 * From the *File* menu, select *"Add BMP Right Click Option"*
 * When prompted to confirm, click *Yes*
 * A dialog should display *Done!*

== Windows 7 ==

Windows 7 users may be met with the following error message when trying to follow the instructions as listed in the Windows XP section above:

{{{Access to registry key ... is denied!}}}

If you do, then you will need to start 2pix in *Administrative Mode* so that 2pix has the necessary  permissions to insert that registry entry. You can do this by *right-clicking* on the shortcut to 2pix and selecting *"Run as Administrator"*. After you do this, follow the XP steps above and you should be able to install the right-click option for 2pix.
